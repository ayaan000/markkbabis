PROBLEM DOMAIN
For our project, we have decided to create a trivia game.

OUR PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION
In this online game, two players compete in gaining the most points by answering questions correctly. 
Before each round, the players select a category for their questions. 
During the round, the player who answers the question correctly first gains the points.
The faster the players answer correctly, the more points they gain.
