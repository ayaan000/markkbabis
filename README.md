CSC207 Group Project

For this project, our team is building the online trivia game. In this game, there are a bunch of questions
from a wide range of subject such as sports, books, video games, general knowledge,... In this game, 2 players are given
the same number of questions. If both players answer question correctly, the faster one gets more point. Player's points 
are deducted if they have the wrong answer. At the end when they finish all question, whoever has more point win. We are
using API from https://opentdb.com/api_config.php.
