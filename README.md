## PROBLEM DOMAIN
For our project, we have decided to create a trivia game.

## HOW THE GAME WORKS
In this  game, the player competes in gaining the most points by answering questions correctly.
Before each game, the players select a category (such as sports, books, video games, etc.) for their questions.
During the round, the player is awarded points based on speed and correctness.
At the end, the players points are tallied with a bot (which can be set to easy/medium/hard)

## OUR PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION

HOME SCREEN
This will be the initial screen that the player sees when entering the game.
They can access settings, instructions to the game, and the play button 
to start the game (which will lead to the lobby).


SETTINGS SCREEN
This screen contains 3 drops down boxes.
1) Drop down to select difficulty between easy medium and hard
2) Drop down to set number of questions they player wants to play, between 5, 10 and 15.
3) 3) Chossing a trivia category (sports, geography, animals etc.)
There will be a start button (which will lead to the play screen).

PLAY SCREEN
The question and four answer options will appear on the screen for the player to click.
Upon correct selection the answer turns green
Upon incorrect selection the chosen option turns red and the correct answer turns green.
